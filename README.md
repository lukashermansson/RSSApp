# RSSApp
A winforms podcast player
##Information
This is an app created as a school project for the course Object Oriented Programming with C#
It was created in a team of 3 students, me being one of them.
The project was graded as completed or not completed acording to the requirements mentioned in the project descripion
I belive we did a decent job with the functionality of the app, it may be lacking in design and a few shortcuts where taken.
Our goal was to structure the code in a good manner. This was in my opinion one of the strengts of our product

##Technical information
The app stores podcast feeds as xml for persitant storage, it reads podcast rss feads with atached audio files.
It downloads the audio files to local storage and plays the files in your prefered media player. 

After the turn in for the project i added a html parser for the episodes, this feature 
was easy to implement but adds a lot of usability to the app, I am very happy with this addition
